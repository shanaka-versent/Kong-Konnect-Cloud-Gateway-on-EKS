# Kong Cloud Gateway on EKS - HTTPRoutes for Kubernetes Gateway API
# @author Shanaka Jayasundera - shanakaj@gmail.com
#
# These route traffic from the Istio Gateway to backend services.
# Kong Cloud Gateway sends traffic to the single Istio Gateway NLB,
# which then uses these HTTPRoutes for path-based routing to pods.
#
# IMPORTANT: This uses HTTPRoute (Gateway API), NOT Ingress resources
